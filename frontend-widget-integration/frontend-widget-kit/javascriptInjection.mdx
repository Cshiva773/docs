## Integration Steps

### 1. Add Script Tag

Add the following script tag to the `<head>` section of your website:

```html html
<script src="https://[SUREBRIGHT_CDN_URL]/path-to-surebright-library.js"></script>
```

### 2. Initialize the Library

After adding the script tag, initialize the SureBright library using the `initialize` method. The `STORE_ID` will be provided as part of the integration guide:

```javascript js
SureBright.initialize({
    "storeId": "STORE_ID"
}, function onInitialisation(response) {
    console.log("Initialization successful", response.storeId);
});
```


ðŸ’¡ Look for this message in console logs to ensure that SureBright has been successfully initialized
