### Program Options

We offer two flexible modes to support your campaign:

1. **White-Glove Campaigns (Recommended)**\
   Our team will handle everything—from setup to execution—for all eligible customers. This is the most hands-off option and ensures high-performing campaigns aligned with best practices.
2. [**Brand-Managed Campaigns**](/klaviyo-integration/brandManagedCampaignGuide)\
   For brands that prefer to control their customer experience, we enable you to use your own email templates and messaging. SureBright provides the necessary data; you bring the creative.

## Steps to Enable Access

To enable the SureBright integration, we require your **Klaviyo Public and Private API Keys**. Follow [this quick guide](https://app.storylane.io/share/gmb05pqr5zbj) to generate and share the keys.

<Note>
  For Brand-Managed Campaigns, refer to the [Brand-Managed Campaign Guide](#) for step-by-step instructions on flow creation, event parameters, and best practices.
