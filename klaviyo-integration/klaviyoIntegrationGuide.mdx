## Overview
This guide explains the two key events SureBright sends to Klaviyo to power your warranty-related marketing flows. Order data from your e-commerce platform is used to determine eligibility, and to generate unique links for eligible end customers receiving the post purchase email. These events enable you to create targeted post-purchase communications for customers with warranty-eligible products and those who have purchased warranties.

## Configure the Integration
Share your [Klaviyo Public Key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267#your-public-api-key-site-id2) with the SureBright Team.

If you want SureBright to handle Warranty related marketing flows and templates then share a Private Key with the SureBright Team by following the [guide](https://app.storylane.io/share/gmb05pqr5zbj).

## Klaviyo Set-up & Defining the Flows
Navigate to the Klaviyo page that allows you to define the [Klaviyo flow](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932) with the initial trigger and filters.

To define the [Post-Purchase Flow](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932) , focus on these Klaviyo fields:
- Trigger - Set to SureBright: Eligible Order. Do not use the generic Placed Order.
- Trigger Filter - Set to "is_eligible: true".
- Use the SureBright-integrated attributes to insert the event data in the communication template. The key attribute to be used is post_purchase_url, which takes the user to a customer-facing page where protection plans can be directly purchased.

## Implementation Use Cases

### SureBright: Eligible Order
- Send follow-up emails encouraging customers to purchase warranties for eligible products
- Create reminder flows for customers who haven't purchased available warranty protection
- Use the post_purchase_url to direct customers to complete their warranty registration

### SureBright: Policy Purchased
- Send warranty confirmation and thank you emails
