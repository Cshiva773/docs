### Program Options

We offer two flexible modes to support your campaign:

1. **White-Glove Campaign Management (Recommended)**\
   Our team will handle everything—from setup to execution—for all eligible customers. This is the most hands-off option and ensures high-performing campaigns aligned with best practices.
2. **Brand-Managed Campaigns**\
   For brands that prefer to control their customer experience, we enable you to use your own email templates and messaging. SureBright provides the necessary data; you bring the creative.

> **Note:** All post-purchase emails must be approved by the SureBright team to ensure brand and compliance alignment.

### Seamless Klaviyo Integration

To power these campaigns, we push the following data directly to your Klaviyo account:

- Warranty plan details
- Order and product information
- Coverage summary
- Personalized post-purchase journey links

This enables you to craft dynamic, timely, and relevant messages to drive conversions and enhance customer trust.

## Installation

We need access to a public key and a private key for enabling the program for you. Here are the steps to help you share the access.

1. Sharing [Klaviyo Public Key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267#your-public-api-key-site-id2)
2. Sharing Klaviyo private key using [guide](https://app.storylane.io/share/gmb05pqr5zbj).

## Implementation Use Cases

### SureBright: Eligible Order
