### Program Options

We offer two flexible modes to support your campaign:

1. **White-Glove Campaign Management (Recommended)**\
   Our team will handle everything—from setup to execution—for all eligible customers. This is the most hands-off option and ensures high-performing campaigns aligned with best practices.
2. **Brand-Managed Campaigns**\
   For brands that prefer to control their customer experience, we enable you to use your own email templates and messaging. SureBright provides the necessary data; you bring the creative.

> **Note:** All post-purchase emails must be approved by the SureBright team to ensure brand and compliance alignment.

### Seamless Klaviyo Integration

To power these campaigns, we push the following data directly to your Klaviyo account:

- Warranty plan details
- Order and product information
- Coverage summary
- Personalized post-purchase journey links

This enables you to craft dynamic, timely, and relevant messages to drive conversions and enhance customer trust.

## Installation

Share your [Klaviyo Public Key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267#your-public-api-key-site-id2) with the SureBright Team.

If you want SureBright to handle Warranty related marketing flows and templates then share a Private Key with the SureBright Team by following the [guide](https://app.storylane.io/share/gmb05pqr5zbj).

## Klaviyo Set-up & Defining the Flows

Navigate to the Klaviyo page that allows you to define the [Klaviyo flow](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932) with the initial trigger and filters.

To define the [Post-Purchase Flow](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932) , focus on these Klaviyo fields:

- Trigger - Set to SureBright: Eligible Order. Do not use the generic Placed Order.
- Trigger Filter - Set to "is_eligible: true".
- Use the SureBright-integrated attributes to insert the event data in the communication template. The key attribute to be used is post_purchase_url, which takes the user to a customer-facing page where protection plans can be directly purchased.
