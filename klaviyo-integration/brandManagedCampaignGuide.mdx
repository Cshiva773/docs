description: "Follow the steps below to configure a Klaviyo Flow that targets customers eligible for warranty upsell emails using your own email templates and messaging"
---

### 1. Navigate to the Flow Builder

- Log in to your Klaviyo account.
- Go to **Flows** from the left-hand menu.
- Click **Create Flow**.
- Choose **Create from Scratch**, and name your flow something like `SureBright Post-Purchase Warranty`.

---

### 2. Set the Trigger

- For the **Trigger**, select **Metric**.
- In the dropdown, \*\*choose \*\*`SureBright: Eligible Order`.

> ⚠️ _Do not use the generic “Placed Order” trigger—this will not capture warranty-eligible events._

---

### 3. Add a Trigger Filter

- After selecting the trigger, click **“Trigger Filters”**.
- Add a condition:
  - **Field:** `is_eligible`
  - **Condition:** `equals`
  - **Value:** `true`

> ✅ This ensures that only orders eligible for a post-purchase warranty offer are included.

---

### 4. Build Your Flow

- Add your **email step(s)** to the flow as desired.
- Use **SureBright event data** to personalize your messaging.

---

### 5. Personalize Using Event Attributes

In your email content, you can dynamically insert values from the SureBright event payload. One key attribute to include is:

- `{{ event.post_purchase_url }}` – This is a unique, customer-facing link where protection plans can be directly purchased.

You can also use additional attributes like:

- `{{ event.order_number }}`
- `{{ event.product_name }}`
- `{{ event.coverage_summary }}`
- `{{ event.customer_first_name }}`

### 6. Submit for Review

Before activating the flow, please submit a preview or test email to the SureBright team for compliance review and approval.
