description: "This document describes how to use Shopify’s Draft Orders to record a warranty sale."
---

A Draft Order in Shopify allows merchants to manually create orders for custom or wholesale sales outside the regular checkout process. It benefits merchants by providing personalized orders, flexible payment options, and the ability to review an invoice before payment. Draft orders reserve inventory, enabling quick adjustments like adding items or modifying quantities. They also allow for special discounts and act as quotations, offering transparency in pricing.

We at SureBright provide a multitude of solutions to cover several sales channels. Please refer to the “Note” section of this document listed at the end to see all the sales channels we can support. And if you need further information or support, please email us at [support@surebright.com](mailto:support@surebright.com) or schedule a meeting with our sales team via [this link](https://meetings.hubspot.com/andy41/into-call-booking-no-strings-attached).
