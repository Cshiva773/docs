title: "Overview"
description: "A Store Category represents a distinct grouping of products within a specific store that are eligible for extended warranty coverage."
---

It is used to determine applicable protection plans based on:

- Product type
- Usage patterns
- Risk profiles

This classification enables stores to tailor warranty offerings to their unique catalog and customer base.

---

## Unique Identification

Each store category is uniquely defined by:

- **Store ID**
- **Product Category**

This ensures that the same product category (e.g., _Televisions_) can have customized warranty rules across different stores—allowing flexibility in **coverage**, **pricing**, and **eligibility**.

---

## Examples of Store Categories

Products within a store category typically share functional or physical characteristics. Common examples include:

- **Consumer Electronics**
  - Smartphones, tablets, laptops
- **Home Appliances**
  - Microwaves, washing machines
- **Major Appliances**
  - Refrigerators, ovens
- **Mobility**
  - E-bikes, hoverboards, electric scooters
- **Furniture**
  - Indoor furniture, outdoor furniture, mattresses, rugs

---

## Coverage Options

Warranty coverage associated with a store category may include:

- **Accidental Damage Protection**
  - Drops, spills, and other unintentional physical damage
- **Mechanical or Electrical Breakdown**
  - Failures occurring after the manufacturer's warranty expires
- **Configurable Plan Features**
  - Deductible options
  - Custom warranty durations

ℹ️ **Recommendation:**\
The **store category-based quotes** functionality is primarily recommended for **POS (Point-of-Sale) stores** that do not have complete product-level information available in their catalog. This approach enables these stores to offer warranty coverage based on broader product classifications rather than individual SKUs.
