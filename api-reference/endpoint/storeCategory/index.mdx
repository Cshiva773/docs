A Store Category defines a unique grouping of products within a specific store that are eligible for extended warranty coverage. It serves as a key classification used to determine applicable protection plans based on product type, usage patterns, and risk profiles.


Each store category is uniquely identified by a combination of the store ID and the product category. This ensures that the same product category (e.g., Televisions) can be defined differently across stores, allowing for customized coverage rules and pricing.


Products within a store category typically share functional or physical similaritiesâ€”for example:


Consumer Electronics (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops)
Home Appliances (e.g., microwaves, washing machines)
Major Appliances (e.g., refrigerators, ovens)
Specialty Items (e.g., electric scooters, drones)



Coverage associated with a store category can include:


Accidental Damage Protection (e.g., drops, spills, physical damage)
Mechanical or Electrical Breakdown (post-manufacturer warranty expiration)
Options with or without deductibles
Custom warranty durations and claim limits



Store categories act as the foundation for configuring warranty plans, pricing models, and eligibility criteria at scale, enabling flexibility across diverse product catalogs and retail partners.
